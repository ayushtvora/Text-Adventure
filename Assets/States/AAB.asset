    are given 5 arrows. You first take aim at a tree, and you miss. The second shot,
    you just barely land. You shoot again at the tree, aiming for a dot on it, and
    get it right in. Your confidence goes up, and you use the remaining arrows to
    shoot down a bunny and a bird.\r\n\r\n1. Try out the sword"
